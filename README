Welcome to MFEM github actions repository.

The goal of this repository is to gather the actions used by MFEM, projects related to MFEM or any other project interested in using them. This prevent use from duplicating and maintaining several copies of similal actions.

Projects using those actions:
- mfem/mfem
- glvis/glvis
- ceed/laghos
- cedd/remhos

Role of different actions:
- *build-hypre* will download and build hypre with some degree of configuration, dictated my mfem typical usage.
- *build-metis* will download and build metis with some degree of configuration, dictated my mfem typical usage.
- *build-mfem* will download and build mfem. This one has more configuration options, since we want to enable building various mfem configuration. It is also intended to build mfem both as the main project (in mfem CI) or as a dependency, in which case one can control what repo and brach to use.
- *updload-coverage* is a standard action to upload coverage information to codecov.
